### For ‘letter marked’ assignments, I will use the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences marking criteria](https://teaching.artsci.utoronto.ca/teachinginas/academichandbook-jitreminders/#finalcourse).

---

### See syllabus for course policies on accessibility, accommodation, academic integrity and late assignments.

---
### This course will have a lot of new material for most people, so as a general rule, it's best to keep an open line of communication with me!
