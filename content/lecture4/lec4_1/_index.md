#### MapBox Studio is your home base.

#### https://studio.mapbox.com

From here you can manually create maps and tweak their designs.

* We can upload data
  * ...and it'll be transformed from its native format into vector tiles.
  * This happens in the **"Datasets"** section

* We can also modify maps
  * ...so that they're designed how we want.
  * Take data they've precompiled and style them to our choosing.
  * This happens in the **"Styles"** section.
