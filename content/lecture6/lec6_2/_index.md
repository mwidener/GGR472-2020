### Let's start with mouse events

* The mouse is the primary mode of interaction with the computer
 * Essential for navigating webpages, web maps, web apps, etc.
* Modern browsers pay close attention to what the mouse is doing
 * Hover, clicks
* Take advantage of this to add interface

* Events are things that happen to elements in the webpage
 * Can be something done by the browser or user
 * JS can react to events and implement code

* Weâ€™ve been doing this already with:

```javascript

map.on('load', function(){
	stuff;
});

```

* Essentially the code is listening for events to happen
	* knows what to implement when that event happens
