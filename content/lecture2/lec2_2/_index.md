## Classifying Web Maps
#### A 2001 paper by Jan Kraak attempted to classify web maps
* Web Maps
  * static maps
    * view only
    * interactive interface/contents
  * dynamic maps
    * view only
    * interactive interface/contents

#### Other ways to think about web maps
* Analytical web maps
  * Basically GIS online
* Animated/Realtime web maps
  * Constantly updated maps showing changes in spatial locations
* Collaborative web maps
  * Teams contribute to a single spatial representation online
* Online atlases
  * Static collections of production quality maps that were formerly printed as books, can be interactive
* Static web maps
  * Pages with maps that have no interactivity
