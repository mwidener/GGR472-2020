## How do we make web maps
#### Approach depends on factors that are similar to how you develop conventional GISystems
* Audience
* Scope
* Refresh rate
* Collaboration strategy
#### New dimensions
* interactivity
* Realtime
* linkages to other online resources

# Group exercise!
* Find an online map on a website that isnâ€™t a major web map provider (e.g. google, microsoft, etc.)
  * Describe the purpose of the map
  * List any interactivity/features
  * Does the map serve its purpose well?
  * What additional features might be nice to have?
